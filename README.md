# HolyChat - Web Application

• Developed the iOS application using Swift by setting up the Firebase SDK and JSQMessagesViewController to
provide realtime data synchronization, authentication and typing detection.

• Built the web application using JavaScript, HTML and CSS which allows users to login with Google account,
check historical messages and upload photos.

• Implemented the same functions for the Android application to provide users cross-platform experience.
